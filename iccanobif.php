// 7 kyu - The iccanobiF Sequence
// Your task is to create an array of size n with the values of the Fibonnaci sequence, and reverse the order in which the sequence is displayed.
//
// For example: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5] would become [5, 3, 2, 1, 1]
//
// You can assume that n will always be a positive integer between and including, 1 and 64.
