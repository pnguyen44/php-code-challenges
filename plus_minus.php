<?php
// Plus Minus
// Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.
//
// For example, given the array arr[1,1,0,-1,-1]  there are 5 elements, two positive, two negative and one zero.
//
// Their ratios would be 2/5 = 0.400000 , 2/5  = 0.400000, and 1/5 = 0.200000. It should be printed as
//
// 0.400000
// 0.400000
// 0.200000
