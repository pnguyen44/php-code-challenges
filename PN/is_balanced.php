<?php
// You are given an array of strings. Each of these strings is made up of bracket characters only :
// '(', ')', '{',  '}',  '[',  ']'.
// Programming languages utilize these brackets in balanced pairs, so the following rules are always followed :
//
// Every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket : '(' with ')', '{' with '}', and '[' with ']'.
// Two brackets form a pair if they have no open bracket of any type between them.
// For example: '[}]' is invalid, '[{}]' is valid.
// The closing bracket of a pair must be of the same type as the opening bracket, e.g. '( )' is valid, but '[ )' is not valid.
// Your task is to determine if of the strings of brackets in the input array are valid or invalid by these criteria.
