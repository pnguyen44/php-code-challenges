<?php
// Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following three lines:
//
// 1. Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
// 2. First Element: firstElement, where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
// 3. Last Element: lastElement, where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
// Hint: To complete this challenge, you must add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.
//
// For example, given a worst-case but small array to sort: a = [6,4,1]  we go through the following steps:
//
// swap    a
// 0       [6,4,1]
// 1       [4,6,1]
// 2       [4,1,6]
// 3       [1,4,6]
//
// It took 3 swaps to sort the array. Output would be
//
// Array is sorted in 3 swaps.
// First Element: 1
// Last Element: 6
